Keep it simple, stupid 3d graphics engine.

## Acknowledgements

I am more a physics guy than a graphics guy. I did not want to spend too much
time to be able to display things on the screen. Thus I thank:
  - **bjz** for its glfw binding and its demos
    (git://github.com/bjz/open.gl-tutorials.git) from which I took a great
    bunch of initialization code
